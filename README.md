Scrapes Airport arrival times and displays results in flights/hour in a graph.

I drive for Uber and I wanted a way to quickly glance at how busy the airport would be.

The airport arrival times page has a lot of listings with much more info than I needed and there were duplicate listings. (Sometimes airlines share flights so a particular flight would be listed multiple times)

I couldn't find a free API so I came across a tutorial about web scraping and applied it to this project. It uses React, chart.js, and cheerio.
